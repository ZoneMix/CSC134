# Let's Get Started

## Welcome to CSC134

In this class, we will be learning the basics of Cyber Operations! To do so, there are a few things that need to be completed before we get started...

### Downloading Kali

In the class, we will be using a operating system called Kali Linux. This is a hacking distribution of Linux and one of the best all-in-one tools you can use as a hacker.

Follow these steps to download Kali:

1. Open `File Explorer` and navigate to your `Documents` folder within the sidebar on the left
2. Right-click within the documents folder in an empty area and create a new folder called `Virtual Machines`
3. Download Kali from [here](https://cdimage.kali.org/kali-2023.2/kali-linux-2023.2-vmware-amd64.7z) and be sure to save the file to the newly created folder under `Documents -> Virtual Machines`
4. Once the file is downloaded it will save as a `7z` file, which you will need to unzip. You should be able to navigate to the `7z` file, right-click on the file, click `Show more options`, hover over 7-Zip, then say `extract files`, then click `ok`.
5. You should now see a new folder created that is the same name as the 7z zip file.

Once you have this downloaded, you will pair up this file with a software called `VMware Workstation Player` to install Kali Linux.

### Using VMware

VMware is a company best known for virtualization and cloud computing software. Essentially, using a product like `VMware Workstation Player` allows you to emulate a computer within the current computer you use, this is what is known as a virtual machine. A virtual machine generally interacts with the host computer hardware while being isolated from the software and host operating system. It is a good practice within the cybersecurity industry to use virtual machines for many different areas of work such as organization, security, and making the most of offensive/defensive tools.

If you do not have VMware Workstation Player installed yet, you can do so [here](https://www.vmware.com/go/getplayer-win). (Assuming you are using Windows as your host operating system)

Once you install this software, open it up and
